# Advent Of Code

These are my solutions to the annual [Advent of Code Events](https://adventofcode.com), Created by the talented [Eric Wastl](http://was.tl/)

## How To Use
If you would like to run any of my solutions:
- First, download the latest release from [Here](https://github.com/BobbyShmurner/advent_of_code/releases/latest)
- Next, create a folder called `inputs` in the same folder as the release binary
- Create another folder that's name corresponds to the year you wish to run (e.g `2022`)
- Place **YOUR** puzzle inputs in the year folder, and make sure to name the file based on the input's corresponding day (e.g `day_1.txt`)
- At this point your directory structure should resemble something along the lines of the following:

```
  - advent_of_code.exe
  - inputs
    - 2022
      - day_1.txt
```

- Enjoy :D
