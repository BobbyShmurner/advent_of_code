# Advent Of Code

These are my solutions to the annual [Advent of Code Events](https://adventofcode.com), Created by the talented [Eric Wastl](http://was.tl/)

## How To Use
If you would like to run any of my solutions:
- First, download the latest release from [Here](https://github.com/BobbyShmurner/advent_of_code/releases/latest)
- Next, create a folder called `inputs` in the same folder as the release binary
- Place **YOUR** puzzle inputs in the `inputs` folder, and make sure to name the file based on the input's corresponding day (e.g `day_1.txt`)
- Enjoy :D
